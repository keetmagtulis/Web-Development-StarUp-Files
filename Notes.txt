Introduction to HTML CSS and JS 

HTML- Hypertext Markup Language

We use HTML to define the structure or building block our web pages 

CSS - Casscading Style Sheet 


Note: index.html is used as the homepage of the HTML

REMEMBER TO ALWAYS USE inspect element in the browser

<title> - refers to the content that appears in the browser 

Use Live server to view the current HTML project
URL 127.0.0.1:5500  - This URL represents the local computer  or the current machine 
The port number 5500 - is which our webserver is listening (the web server is waiting for the http request on this port)

image element - <img src="" alt="">

In this function there are 2 attributes 

source(src) is where you determine the path of the image

alternative text (alt) is used when the image can't be displayed and instead displaying a text 

style element - <stlye></style>

This is where we write our css declerations. Use a semicollon to use mulitple css declerations.

Examples of CSS declerations - 

width - used to adjust img size 
border-raduis - used to adjust borders of the images

TIPS: If you use a value for the border radius half of the width you will get a round image. 

CLASS (Classification) - class attribute is used to specify an element

Example <p class="main"></p>

call diss element in CSS as 
 .main {
    font-weight: bold; 
 }
