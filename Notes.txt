Introduction to HTML CSS and JS 

HTML- Hypertext Markup Language

We use HTML to define the structure or building block our web pages 

CSS - Casscading Style Sheet 


Note: index.html is used as the homepage of the HTML

REMEMBER TO ALWAYS USE inspect element in the browser

<title> - refers to the content that appears in the browser 

Use Live server to view the current HTML project
URL 127.0.0.1:5500  - This URL represents the local computer  or the current machine 
The port number 5500 - is which our webserver is listening (the web server is waiting for the http request on this port)

image element - <img src="" alt="">

In this function there are 2 attributes 

source(src) is where you determine the path of the image

alternative text (alt) is used when the image can't be displayed and instead displaying a text 

style element - <stlye></style>

This is where we write our css declerations. Use a semicollon to use mulitple css declerations.

Examples of CSS declerations - 

width - used to adjust img size 
border-raduis - used to adjust borders of the images

TIPS: If you use a value for the border radius half of the width you will get a round image. 

CLASS (Classification) - class attribute is used to specify an element

Example <p class="main"></p>

call diss element in CSS as 
 .main {
    font-weight: bold; 
 }

 BASIC HTML BOILERPLATE (Basic HTML Template) 

Type ! and press tab 

HEAD Section (Meta Elements)

<head></head>

Head section has meta elements 

Examples: 
<meta charset="UTF-8">
character set - most of the character set we use this days is UTF-8 (it can display almost all characters in the world) 

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
viewport - it configures the viewport it is the visible area of the webpage. We need this element to make our webpage look good on all devices. 

 <meta name="keywords" content="Ramen, noodles">
 keywords - is used to define the webpage.

 <meta name="description" content="What you see here is the description that is displayed when you search for the webpage">
 description- it displays the description when you search the webpage on search engines. 

 META Elements - we can give information about the webpage. 

 Emphasis (em) element - Gives emphasis to the text 

        <p> I love <em>Ramen</em></p>
       <p> I love <strong>Ramen</strong></p>
       <p> I love <i>Ramen</i></p>

These elements are deprecated because styling should be done in CSS 

HTML has 6 Headings 

<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h4></h4>
<h5></h5>
<h6></h6>

h1 as the most important heading 
 
 Every webpage must have only 1 h1 element as it tells the search engines what is the webpage all about 
 having mulitple h1 elements will confuse the search engines. 
 If you are using h1 the next heading element must be h2 you should not skip 

 Entities 

 All HTML Entities must be stored in between &;

Example


<p> I love &lt;HTML&gt;! </p>

lt - less than sign 
gt - greater than sign 
copy - copy right symbol 
&nbsp - non breaking space 

ABOUT function 

<a href="about.html">About Page</a>

Declare an html file using a href command ang the path of the html file
